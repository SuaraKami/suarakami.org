"Apa Kabar Papua" was a year-end forum designed to listen first. It created space for Papuan students and invited guests from journalism and academia to share experiences of discrimination, discuss current developments, and situate Papua's challenges within Indonesia's broader democratic context. The room mixed testimony and analysis, encouraging dialogue over debate and empathy over labels.

Speakers included Renhard Leo Leleran (Chair, Papuan Student Association in Germany/PMP), Yustisia Anastasia Temongmere and Reza Dani Christy Rumbiak (PMP), Yitzhak Simatupang (Chair, PPI Jerman 2019/2020), Hendra Pasuhuk (Senior Journalist, DW), and Dr. Fidelis Regi Waton SVD (Catholic priest and philosophy lecturer). The event was also supported by organisations including PMP, PPI Jerman, PPI Aachen, KMKI Aachen, and Arbeitskreis Indonesien e.V.

Between the discussion blocks, the program featured acoustic music and traditional dance; the evening closed with a shared potluck meal that kept conversations going long after the Q&A ended.

Set against heated national debates on race, identity, and civic rights, the event asked a simple question: what does a fair public conversation about Papua sound like? The answer, at least for one evening, was careful listening, multiple perspectives, and an appetite to learn together.
