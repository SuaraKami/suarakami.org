SuaraKami continued The Series: Sofa Talk with a discussion on one of Indonesia's most pressing digital issues — the rise of data breaches and the importance of cybersecurity awareness. Hosted by Farhan Sasono and Deyland, the session featured Evan, a cybersecurity consultant, who shared his perspective on data protection and digital responsibility in Indonesia.

The discussion began with recent cases such as data leaks from public institutions and online lending platforms. Evan highlighted that many breaches occur not from sophisticated hacking but from human error and institutional negligence. He explained that in countries like Germany, privacy is considered a human right, while in Indonesia, awareness of data protection remains limited.

Throughout the session, the speakers reflected on how digital habits — from oversharing on social media to using free online services — can unintentionally expose users to privacy risks. They also discussed the newly passed Personal Data Protection Law (UU PDP), recognizing it as a milestone while noting the need for stronger enforcement and public education.

The event concluded with practical advice for the audience: strengthening password security, reviewing app permissions, and being more selective about the information shared online. Sofa Talk: Data Breach emphasized that cybersecurity is not only a technical issue but also a social and ethical one — urging young Indonesians to treat data protection as part of their rights and responsibilities in the digital age.
