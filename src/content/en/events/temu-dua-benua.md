"Temu Dua Benua" was a two-part online collaboration by Generasi Melek Politik (Indonesia), SuaraKami (Germany), and Energy Academy Indonesia (ECADIN), launched at the height of the pandemic to connect workers, employers, experts, and policymakers across regions. The series combined data-driven presentations with open Q&A to translate crisis into practical understanding and options for action.

The first session, "Dihantam Corona, Diinjak PHK" (3 May 2020), discussed workers' rights and company obligations amid mass layoffs. Featuring Faisal Basri (Economist), Sandiaga Uno (Entrepreneur and Politician), Fadjroel Rachman (Presidential Spokesperson), and Reiga Andra (Generasi Melek Politik), moderated by Ayu Dewi (SuaraKami), the discussion examined the government's policy responses — including Kartu Prakerja — and their relevance during an emergency economy.

The second session, "Live Alongside COVID-19: See the Impacts, Find the Solutions" (7 June 2020), shifted focus to local governments' roles in recovery. Speakers included Ganjar Pranowo (Governor of Central Java), Hendrar Prihadi (Mayor of Semarang), Roby Muhammad, PhD (Sociologist), and Alfatih Timur (CEO of Kitabisa.com), moderated by Annisa Wiharani (PhD researcher, University of Groningen). This discussion emphasized innovation, social resilience, and youth participation in rebuilding communities during the pandemic.

Together, the two sessions built a bridge between Indonesia and Europe, showing how transparent data and collaborative discussion could steady public decision-making when anxiety—and misinformation—were at their peak.
