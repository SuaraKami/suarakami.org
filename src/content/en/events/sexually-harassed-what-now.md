In collaboration with PPI Aachen, PPI Jerman, PPI Franken, PPI Kaiserslautern, and the Indonesian Embassy in Berlin (KBRI Berlin), SuaraKami joined as moderator and co-organizer in the two-part webinar "Sexually Harassed, What Now?". The event aimed to raise awareness and provide clear information about legal protection, reporting procedures, and trauma recovery for victims of sexual harassment.

The first session, "Law and Protection: Seeking Justice" (12 June 2022), featured Kombes Pol. Ade J. H. Sinaga from KBRI Berlin and Magdalena Bernhardt from Bernhardt Law Firm, discussing the UU TPKS (Sexual Violence Law) and legal procedures in both Indonesia and Germany.

The second session, "The Trauma: What's Left and Never Goes Away" (19 June 2022), focused on the psychological aftermath and long-term support for survivors.

By connecting legal experts, institutions, and students across Germany, the webinar fostered understanding, empathy, and empowerment, encouraging participants to speak up and support a safer community for all.
