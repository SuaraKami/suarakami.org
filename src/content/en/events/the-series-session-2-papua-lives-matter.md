Amid the global wave of protests following the George Floyd case, SuaraKami launched "The Series: Sofa Talk" — an open conversation on racism in Indonesia, focusing on discrimination against Papuans. The discussion featured Yustisia Temongmere and W. P. Leo Leleran from the Papuan Students Association in Germany (PMP), who spoke candidly about everyday prejudice, historical injustice, and the parallels between Black Lives Matter and the Papuan experience.

They explored how stereotypes, media bias, and lack of education perpetuate systemic racism, emphasizing that such issues are not confined to the U.S. but exist deeply within Indonesian society. The speakers urged listeners to recognize ignorance as a root cause, educate themselves, and keep conversations about Papua alive — because silence enables injustice. The event concluded with a call for empathy, equality, and self-reflection among Indonesian youth to build a more inclusive future.
