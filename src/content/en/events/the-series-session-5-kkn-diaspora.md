The Series: KKN – Kadang Kadang Ngopi introduced a fresh and more personal format within SuaraKami's ongoing effort to foster open and inclusive discussions. Held on June 17th, 2023, at Humboldt-Haus RWTH Aachen, the event carried the theme "Diaspora: Di Luar Menjejak Dunia, Pulang Penuh Tanda Tanya." Unlike previous structured webinars, this session took the shape of a relaxed community gathering — coffee in hand, snacks on the table, and honest conversations all around.

The event explored what it means to be part of the Indonesian diaspora — individuals who live abroad, study, or work while carrying a deep connection to Indonesia. Participants reflected on their shared experiences of adaptation, nostalgia, and identity, discussing the opportunities and challenges of living overseas. A central question lingered: after studying or working abroad, should one return home to contribute directly, or stay abroad and contribute in other ways?

Through stories, laughter, and thoughtful exchanges, the conversation revealed the complexities behind these choices. Many attendees expressed a desire to gain further experience before returning to Indonesia, citing factors such as limited technological infrastructure, work culture, and opportunities for growth back home. Others emphasized the value of building international perspectives and networks that could ultimately benefit Indonesia from afar.

Ultimately, KKN became more than a casual hangout — it was a reflection on belonging and purpose. It highlighted how today's generation of Indonesian youth abroad continue to find meaningful ways to serve and stay connected to their homeland, no matter the distance.
