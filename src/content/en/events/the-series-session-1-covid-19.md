The first session of The Series, released in April 2020, featured conversations with Indonesians living in Japan, South Korea, Italy, and Indonesia, each offering a unique look into how different countries were handling the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The episode stars Ganang from Osaka, Japan, who described the government's cautious approach, voluntary restrictions, and social discipline that shaped daily life under minimal lockdowns. Salma from Seoul shared insights into South Korea's world-recognized strategies — transparent data sharing, mass testing, and financial support systems that helped control infection rates early on. Rani from Bologna, Italy, reflected on living in one of the hardest-hit regions in Europe, recounting strict lockdowns, overwhelmed hospitals, and community resilience. Finally, Aji, a doctor from Yogyakarta, discussed hospital readiness in Indonesia, discrimination faced by healthcare workers, and local mitigation efforts.

The session aimed to document and share firsthand stories during the early months of the pandemic, offering insight into how Indonesians across the world experienced and responded to an unprecedented global crisis.
