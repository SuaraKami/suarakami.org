In October 2019, SuaraKami held "Saatnya Pemuda Turun Tangan", a discussion event addressing key issues surrounding Indonesia's democracy and civic space. The forum explored pressing topics such as racism in Papua, criminalization of activists, and several controversial law revisions including those on the KPK, penal code, land reform, and correctional law, as well as environmental crises like forest fires. The aim was to provide a space for young Indonesians abroad to understand, question, and engage with these developments.

To enrich the conversation, the event featured speakers Hendra Pasuhuk (Senior Journalist, DW), Sri Tunruang (Human Rights Activist), Haikal A. Sulaeman and Arnold B. Prasetyo (Youth Activists), moderated by Ayu R.D. Dewi, with an opening by Asa Detristo, SuaraKami's coordinator.

Beyond the discussion, the program also included music, stand-up comedy, and traditional dance performances, creating a lively and inclusive atmosphere where reflection met creativity and community.
