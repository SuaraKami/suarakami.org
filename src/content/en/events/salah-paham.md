Marking twenty-five years since Indonesia's Reformasi, SuaraKami and AK-Indonesien e.V. convened Salah paHAM ("Misunderstanding Human Rights"), a large public dialogue examining Indonesia's long and complicated relationship with human rights. The title played on the dual meaning of "understanding" and "misunderstanding," inviting participants to rethink what human rights truly mean in the Indonesian context.

The event was inspired by President Joko Widodo's 2023 acknowledgment of twelve major human-rights violations throughout Indonesia's modern history—from the 1965–66 mass killings to Trisakti, Talangsari, and the Papua conflicts. While this acknowledgment was a milestone, it also reopened debate about the limits of non-judicial resolution through the newly created PPHAM (Team for the Non-Judicial Resolution of Past Gross Human Rights Violations). Salah paHAM sought to explore these issues critically: how far has Indonesia progressed since Reformasi, and how much remains only partially addressed?

Speakers reflected a wide spectrum of expertise and experience: Dr. Hilmar Farid (Director General of Culture), Beka Ulung Hapsara (Komnas HAM), Ayu Purwaningsih (senior journalist), Jürgen Jansen (political scientist), Andrej Hunko (former MEP), and Reza Dani Rumbiak and Yustisia Temongmere from the Papuan Student Association in Germany (PMP).

The accompanying presentation walked the audience through key milestones and widespread public misconceptions—such as the idea that "human rights are a Western concept" or that "time alone heals all wounds." Each misconception was challenged with facts and moral reasoning.

Beyond the academic content, Salah paHAM created an emotional and cultural space. The evening concluded with a Balinese dance and a choir performance by KMKI Aachen—symbols of empathy and shared identity. Participants left with a clearer understanding that confronting history is not an act of division but a commitment to democracy, accountability, and healing.
