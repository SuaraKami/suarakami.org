Returning to an in-person forum after two years, SuaraKami hosted "Climate Checkmate" to examine the climate crisis where technology, policy, and civic life intersect. Framed by the global energy shock linked to the war in Ukraine and the race to meet climate targets, the event set out not to pick sides but to map a practical middle ground between fossil and renewable energy in Indonesia—politically and technically. It also compared approaches in Indonesia and Germany and invited students to see where public pressure and voting matter most in the run-up to elections.

Speakers included Rafiandy Dwi Putra, an RWTH Aachen alumnus in waste-to-energy research; Ryan Bobby Andika, President of the Society of Petroleum Engineers RWTH Aachen; Mikhail Gorbachev Dom, environmental spokesperson from the Indonesian Solidarity Party; and Dimitri Dwi Putra, Presidium of the Indonesian Green Party. Moderated by SuaraKami members Asa and Hani, the discussion invited students to reflect on sustainable practices and civic participation in shaping climate policy.

The program ran as two bilingual sessions with a short coffee break, keeping a lively, participatory rhythm that encouraged questions from first-timers as much as from energy wonks. By the end, the audience had a clearer map of trade-offs: costs and reliability, emissions and local impacts, political feasibility and timelines. Rather than settling debates, "Climate Checkmate" asked attendees to carry them forward—into student groups, polling booths, and everyday choices—so climate policy is shaped by informed citizens, not just by headlines.
