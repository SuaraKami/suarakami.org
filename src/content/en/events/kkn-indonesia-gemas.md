As Indonesia moves closer to its 2045 centennial milestone, SuaraKami revisits its Kadang Kadang Ngopi (KKN) format with an informal yet thought-provoking discussion titled "Indonesia (G)Emas." The title itself played on the words emas (gold) and gemas (frustrated-but-endearing)—reflecting both the optimism and skepticism surrounding the government's "Indonesia Emas 2045" vision.

The gathering invited students and young professionals in Aachen to share critical reflections on the nation's trajectory toward that vision: would Indonesia's demographic bonus truly deliver prosperity, or remain another unfulfilled promise? While the tone of the discussion remained relaxed—over coffee, snacks, and a warm potluck table—the content dug deep into issues of education, human resources, inequality, and economic dependency.

Participants unpacked structural realities behind Indonesia's development slogans: skill gaps in the labor force, stagnating educational reform, and an overreliance on raw material exports. As data and anecdotes surfaced, the mood oscillated between irony and concern. Yet amid the skepticism, an unexpected optimism emerged—an understanding that change often begins with awareness and dialogue.

KKN Indonesia (G)Emas embodied SuaraKami's grassroots spirit: no podiums or hierarchies, only circles of discussion where every voice mattered. Between laughter, shared stories, and the aroma of coffee, participants left with renewed curiosity about their role in shaping the nation's long road toward 2045—not as passive witnesses, but as part of a generation determined to "take the wheel," however small their steering might be.
