The Series: Recap 2022 wrapped up the year with a lighthearted yet critical look at major events in Indonesia. Presented by Nalika Kindiarsa, the segment highlighted four key moments: the passing of the National Capital Law (IKN), the long-awaited ratification of the Sexual Violence Law (TPKS), the early release of corruption convicts, and the rushed approval of the Revised Criminal Code (RKUHP).

Through wit and commentary, Recap 2022 invited audiences to reflect on Indonesia's political trajectory — reminding viewers that awareness and critical thinking remain vital tools for democracy.
