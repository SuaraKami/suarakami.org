about: |
  SuaraKami is a youth-led community of Indonesians in Aachen. We were born from the belief that we all need a safe space to share ideas openly, welcomed with curiosity, then refined through constructive debate.

  We publish independent stories that make public issues clear and human, host seminars and community dialogues where people can practice respectful debate and every voice is heard, and build a digital platform to turn shared knowledge into real action.

  Our goal is clear: to strengthen the public from the ground up and help shape a fairer Indonesia that is not easily captured by narrow interests. We remain idealistic yet pragmatic, take the side of the public interest, and work collaboratively in the spirit of gotong royong.
