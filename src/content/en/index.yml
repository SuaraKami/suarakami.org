about: |
  SuaraKami is a community made by Indonesians in Germany. We were born out of the need for a safe and open space where ideas can be shared freely, curiosity is encouraged, and discussions grow into thoughtful and constructive debates.

  Our goal is simple: to strengthen the public from the ground up and contribute to a fairer, more participatory Indonesia.

  We organize open discussions, seminars, and community dialogues that invite people to engage critically with current events and public issues. Alongside that, we repackage these topics into accessible, human-centered conversations and continue developing digital platforms to turn shared knowledge into actions.

  Rooted in the spirit of gotong royong, we stay idealistic yet pragmatic, always taking the side of the public and believing that change begins with open minds and collective effort.
